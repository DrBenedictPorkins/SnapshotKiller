# ImageMonitor

ImageMonitor is a macOS menu bar application born out of a common screenshot management problem. While macOS offers various screenshot options (like ‚áß‚åÉ‚åò4 for clipboard-only captures), some applications don't handle clipboard-pasted images well, forcing users to save screenshots as files (‚áß‚åò4). These files can quickly accumulate and clutter your desktop or screenshots folder.

ImageMonitor solves this problem by automatically detecting new screenshot files and offering timed deletion options, helping keep your directories clean and organized.

## Features
